## Reflection  

This week connected the dots between **network devices and governance**.  
Learning VLANs made me appreciate why big organizations segment traffic ... it’s not overkill; it’s smart design.  

At **Inspiredu**, I got to see those same principles play out in real life: documenting hardware, verifying data wipes, and managing inventory responsibly. That’s GRC 101 ... governance and accountability start at the asset level.  

The biggest lesson?  
Security isn’t only about firewalls and passwords ... it starts with knowing what you have and where it lives.  

Between switch configs, cable checks, and reimaging dusty PCs, I learned patience, process, and purpose.  

**Real Talk:**  
Still catching myself mixing VLAN IDs at times, but the flow’s getting natural.  
Every lab, every project ... another brick in the foundation.  

**Quote of the Week:**  
Order is security. Whether it’s a network or a neighborhood.  

Let’s see what Week 9 brings.
