## Reflection

This week I dug deeper into IP addressing, subnetting, and basic troubleshooting ... the backbone of every solid network. At first, subnetting felt like trying to solve a math puzzle with too many numbers, but after a few labs and practice problems, it started making sense. 

The biggest lesson? Every device on a network needs the right address, just like every house needs the right mailbox. One wrong octet, and communication shuts down for the whole block.

I also realized how important it is to slow down and actually read system messages. Most “mystery” errors tell you exactly what’s wrong if you just pay attention.  

This week’s work reminded me: networking is part logic, part patience, and a whole lot of problem-solving.

## Real Talk
Some subnetting math still cooking my brain, but I’m getting it.  
Showed up, practiced, broke things, fixed them... that’s progress.


Let's see what Week 8 brings.
