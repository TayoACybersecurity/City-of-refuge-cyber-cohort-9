# Week 7 Reflection – City of Refuge Cyber Cohort

## What Went Down
This week we dug deep into networking, OSI model, IPs, routers, and real-world troubleshooting.  
Outside of class, I kept the grind going with CompTIA Network+ labs and a few AI tools in my homelab.  
Also hit a couple of networking events that gave me more clarity on where I’m headed.  

**Key Takeaways**
OSI layers finally make sense (especially 1–4)
Learned to trace packets and test network paths  
Connected an RJ45 to a CAT5 cable (my first real cable job)
Started documenting everything on GitHub (accountability > perfection)

**Networking Event Gems**
“Fail forward ... nobody starts as an expert”
“Show your work online ... that’s your new resume”

## Real Talk
Some subnetting math still cooking my brain, but I’m getting it.  
Showed up, practiced, broke things, fixed them... that’s progress.


Let's see what Week 8 brings.
