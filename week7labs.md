# Week 7 – Lab Notes (AI + IoT Focus)

## Lab 1: Understanding My Home Network
Mapped all connected devices from router (192.168.1.1)
Found IoT devices: Ring doorbell, Smart TV, Alexa
Learned DHCP gives each device its own IP
Realized all devices share one network = security risk

## Lab 2: Ping & Traceroute
ping 192.168.1.1 (router) ... 1ms
ping 8.8.8.8 (Google) ... 15ms  
tracert google.com ... 12 hops  
Now I know how to test network issues before calling the ISP.

## Lab 3: ChatGPT Troubleshooting Simulation
Used AI to simulate broken network scenarios  
Diagnosed DHCP and DNS issues using the OSI model  
Practiced identifying which layer the problem sits on  

## Lab 4: AI-Powered Study Partner
Used ChatGPT to simplify subnetting and network diagrams  
Example prompt: “Explain switches like I’m 12”  
Helps me learn faster and document cleaner

## Lab 5: IoT Home Lab Project
Noticed IoT devices share my main WiFi  
Plan to create a guest network or VLAN for them  
Goal: Understand IoT security and how AI fits into home automation
